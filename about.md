## About coding-group

This is a summary about the current ideas for the group.


### Objective
The main objective will be to have coding seminars-workshops in which we can share and improve our coding knowledge. We can also use the seminars as a space to discuss what are the current trends in scientific programming. 

### Dynamics
- The plan is to set 2 sessions per semester of around 45 minutes each. 
- The lenght of the talks are flexible: 15-40 minutes. In case of short talks we can have two presenters (20 minutes each: 15m talk + 5m questions).
- Presenters are encouraged to share a cheat-sheet (summary) of their presentations.
- We can collect these summaries and have them available in a repository or in the website of the stats group. 
- Feedback about the duration of the session will always be welcome. Besides we can vote por possible future topics that we can explore together. 

### Topics

The presenter can share about:

- Tools (library / program / app) that is used in the coding and share, for example, how accesible it was to work with the tool, advantages or disadvantages, etc.
- Coding paradigms that they have found useful.
- New programming languages.
- Workflows that help with productivity in coding.
- Applications or miscellaneous coding topics like code and data organization or debugging.

### Acknowledgments 

- We thank the speakers and the collaboration of E.S. üêà and S.V. ‚ö°Ô∏è who helped to set this up.
